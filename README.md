# Getting started

This project uses Yarn so to install dependencies run `yarn` in the project
root.

## Developing

Once youâ€™ve installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
